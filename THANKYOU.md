# THANK YOU

Countless hours have been spent working on this project, and so many people have contributed to its development. Here are some of the people that team LibertyOS would like to thank for their work:


## Carol Nichols
She contributed to the official book for the Rust programming language.


## Philipp Oppermann
His excellent series of tutorials about OS-development in Rust were directly responsible for making this project possible. Without Philipp, the foundations would have taken far longer to implement. Furthermore, the choice to use Rust as the main language for LibertyOS was entirely due to the excellent work that Philipp has done in this field.


## Redox
The team over at RedoxOS have contributed more to the field of OS-development with Rust than anybody, and their kernel has been very helpful for learning more about what LibertyOS should work towards.

## Steve Klabnik
He contributed to the official book for the Rust programming language.


## Vincent Ollivier
Created MOROS, which is another Rust-based operating system. His OS has been very helpful for studying and learning how to work with Rust, and how to implement the features that LibertyOS has been in need of for a long time.

## Xiliang Chen
Created lite-json, which was used as the foundation for data::json.


### In addition to the aforementioned individuals, LOS would like to thank the members of the Discord group, the people over on the Rust subreddit, and the wonderful community that exists on Github!
