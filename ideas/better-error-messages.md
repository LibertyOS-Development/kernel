# Better Error Messages - July 13, 2023 - Daniel Teberian
I was listening to somebody explain how the Rust compiler is far better than any other compiler, and one of the things that Rust's compiler does well with is how it explains errors to people. The kernel has the ability to report errors, but the error messages are not too helpful. Perhaps we could include messages that explain what caused the error, and how the user could fix the error. As of right now, the error messages are virtually impossible for anybody to understand unless they have been actually developing the kernel.

I want to apologize for the mistakes that I have made in developing the kernel. I have done my best to remove the things that really made understanding the kernel even more complicated than necessary, and I am going to continue improving the kernel's documentation, organization, and overall performance. This idea is one that addresses an issue that I created, and I apologize for the way I made the kernel so confusing.
