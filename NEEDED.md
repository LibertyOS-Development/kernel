# Needed Changes
This file lists all the issues that need to be addressed, the features that need to be implemented, and other things for developers to work on.


## Bugs
 - For some reason, the arrow keys and backspace do not work in the terminal. The functionality should be there, but it is not working for some reason.
 - The memory allocation system needs to be rewritten. It does not work consistently.
 - When the user types and the text is at the bottom of the screen, pressing "enter" will copy the bottom line onto any new line. The bottom line can be rewritten, but it is still copied when "enter" is pressed.


## Features


## Misc. Tasks
 - The kernel is in need of documentation.
 - The modules of the kernel would benefit from being rewritten and cleaned up.
 - Eventually, the kernel should be able to run without any external dependencies.
