LibertyOS is something that will be unlike any existing operating system. LibertyOS is written primarily in Rust-an increasingly popular language for low-level programming (among other things). LOS is written entirely from scratch, down to its libraries, its programs, tests, and so on. LOS is also entirely free-to-use, and is open-sourced, so you are welcome to help make LOS even better!
